# GA4GH Software Security Implementation Guide #

This software security implementation guide is under development by the [GA4GH](http://genomicsandhealth.org) Software Security Task Team, part of the Security Working Group.

This document is intended to provide implementation guidelines, examples, recommendations, and best practices for the current [Security Framework](https://genomicsandhealth.org/files/public/SecurityFramework-v1.1-2015-03-12-FINAL.pdf). We hope that the software security guidelines will help GA4GH implementors across all projects meet with these requirements with minimal pain. We welcome your contributions and feedback!
