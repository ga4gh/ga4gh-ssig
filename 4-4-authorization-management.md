# 4.4 Authorization Management #

## Policies and Procedures ##

> Each service provider is responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for determining whether a requesting institutional or individual service consumer is granted access to data and services, and for authorizing rights and privileges associated with that access.


## Third Party Authorization ##

> Vetted authorizations issued by trusted third parties may be used as a basis for authorizing service consumers access rights and privileges. For example, a Research Passport issued through the UK National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Research Passport System,[9] may be used as the basis for authorizing researchers access rights and privileges to passport holders.


## Roles ##

> Each service provider should assure that security-critical functions and responsibilities are assigned to multiple roles and multiple individuals in order to avoid conflicts of interest and to prevent inappropriate activities.


## Principle of Minimal Privilege ##

> Each service provider assigns to each service consumer the minimum access rights and privileges necessary, consistent with the userâ€™s identity, affiliation, role, and/or context. Each service provider is responsible for configuring service APIs and service platforms so that they allow access consistent with the privacy and security policy, while blocking inappropriate uses and accesses.


## Adjudication ##

> Each service provider will document its policies and procedures for adjudicating requests for access to data and services.
