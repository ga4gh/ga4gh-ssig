# 4-6 Cryptographic Controls #

## Legal Compliance ##

> Each stakeholder will assure that the cryptographic controls used are compliant with all relevant agreements, laws, and regulations.

## Data Encryption ##

> Each stakeholder that stores genomic or clinical data will use strong encryption to encrypt the data for storage.

## Separation of Keys ##

> Each stakeholder will assure that plaintext data encryption keys are not stored in the same system as the data encrypted with those keys. When a key hierarchy is used, plaintext key encryption keys should be stored separately from the system storing data encryption keys.

## Encryption in Transit ##

> Each service provider will use end-to-end transport-level encryption (see section 4.9) to encrypt and integrity-protect data during transmission.
